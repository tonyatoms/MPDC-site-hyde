# MPDC-site-hyde
The first version of the website for the McKinley Park Development Council community organization. It was generated via Hugo and used the Hyde theme. The theme did not provide enough menu options, so we ditched it for a different theme, which can be found at tonyatoms/MPDC-site.

See the Hugo Documentation at https://gohugo.io/documentation/ for implementation details.

Initial versions of the site use the awesome Hyde Theme https://github.com/spf13/hyde
