      <description>With vacant lots, demolitions, and rezoning applications pointing to new development coming to McKinley Park, the McKinley Park Development Council (MPDC) invites you and your neighbors to attend our inaugural workshop - a Citizens Guide to Zoning: Understanding how development works in your neighborhood.
Join MPDC and your neighbors to learn and ask questions about what zoning is; how it works; and what it means for our neighborhood, so we can move forward, together, with more knowledge!</description>
