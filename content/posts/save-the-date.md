With vacant lots, demolitions, and rezoning applications pointing to new development coming to McKinley Park, the McKinley Park Development Council (MPDC) invites you and  your neighbors to attend our inaugural workshop -  a Citizens Guide to Zoning: Understanding how development works in your neighborhood. 

Join MPDC and your neighbors to learn and ask questions about what zoning is; how it works; and what it means for our neighborhood, so we can move forward, together, with more knowledge! 
 
But first, MPDC wants to hear from YOU!  Please take a few minutes to complete a quick survey at:  [McKinley Park Community Interest Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/N9FQVPN).  It wonâ€™t take more than 5 minutes out of your day and we would greatly appreciate your feedback.  
 
Plan to join MPDC for an informative evening:
